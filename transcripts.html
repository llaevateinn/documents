  In the early years of my study, I faced challenges related to undiagnosed Asperger traits, which affected my exam<br />

  My turning point came when I discovered a strong interest in geometry –- first through algebraic topology, then <br />
  differential geometry –- gave me motivation and clarity, leading me to progress in academic performance.</div><br />
